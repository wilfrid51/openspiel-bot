Setup: Each player has N dice (1-5 depending on variant). All players roll their dice secretly.

Goal: Make bids about total dice across ALL players, or call "Liar" on opponent's bid.

Actions:
- Bid (quantity, face): Claim there are at least 'quantity' dice showing 'face' among all dice.
- Call Liar: Challenge the previous bid.

Bidding rules: Each bid must be higher than the previous bid. "Higher" means:
  - Same face value but higher quantity (e.g., "2 fours" beats "1 four")
  - Same quantity but higher face value (e.g., "2 fives" beats "2 fours")

Wild dice: 6s are WILD and count as ANY face value.
- When counting dice for a bid, include 6s in the count
- Example: Bid "3 fours" means at least 3 dice showing EITHER 4 OR 6

Winning: If you call Liar and previous bid was false, opponent loses. If bid was true or exact, you lose.
