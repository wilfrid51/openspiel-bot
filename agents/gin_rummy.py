SETUP:
- 52-card deck, each player receives 7-10 cards (variant dependent)
- Goal: Form MELDS to minimize DEADWOOD (unmelded cards)

MELDS (Valid Combinations):
1. SET: 3+ cards of SAME RANK (e.g., 7♠ 7♥ 7♣)
2. RUN: 3+ CONSECUTIVE cards of SAME SUIT (e.g., 5♦ 6♦ 7♦)
Examples:
- Valid runs: A♠-2♠-3♠, 9♥-10♥-J♥-Q♥, 10♣-J♣-Q♣-K♣
- Invalid: K♠-A♠-2♠ (Ace is LOW only, not wraparound)

CARD NOTATION:
- Ranks: A(Ace), 2-9, T(10), J(Jack), Q(Queen), K(King)
- Suits: s(spades♠), h(hearts♥), d(diamonds♦), c(clubs♣)
- Example: 7c = 7 of clubs, Th = 10 of hearts, As = Ace of spades

GAME PHASES:
1. FirstUpcard: Choose to draw first upcard or pass (action IDs: 52=Draw upcard, 54=Pass)
2. Draw: Choose to draw from upcard or stock pile (action IDs: 52=Draw upcard, 53=Draw stock)
3. Discard: Choose which card to discard (action ID = card's index number, shown in Legal Actions)
4. Layoff: After opponent knocks, add cards to their melds or pass (action IDs: card indices or 54=Pass)
5. Knock: Declare end of hand when deadwood ≤ knock_card value

EACH TURN:
1. DRAW phase: Pick from stock pile (53) OR discard pile upcard (52)
2. DISCARD phase: Choose ONE card from hand to discard (use card's action ID from Legal Actions)

KNOCKING:
- When deadwood ≤ knock_card value (8-10), you MAY knock to end hand
- Gin: ALL cards form melds (0 deadwood) = 25-point bonus

SCORING: Winner scores difference in deadwood point values.
Card Values: A=1, 2-10=face value, J=11, Q=12, K=13

IMPORTANT: Always respond with the action ID number ONLY, never card names."""
