Setup: Each player has 15 checkers. Board has 24 points (triangles). Players move in opposite directions.
Goal: Move all your checkers to your home board, then bear them off.

Turn: Roll 2 dice. Move checkers forward by dice values. If doubles, move 4 times.
Movement: Can land on empty point, your own checkers, or single opponent checker (hit it to bar).
Bar: Hit checkers must re-enter from opponent's home board before other moves.

Bearing off: Once all checkers in home board, remove them by rolling their point number or higher.
Winning: First to bear off all checkers wins.

UNDERSTANDING THE BOARD:
- The board display shows a top-down view with 24 points
- 'x' represents your (Player 1's) checkers, 'o' represents opponent's (Player 0's) checkers
- Bar: shows checkers that were hit and must re-enter
- Actions show moves like "8/5/3" meaning move from point 8 to 5 to 3

STRATEGY TIPS:
- Early game: Move checkers forward to establish control
- Avoid leaving single checkers exposed (blots) where possible
- Try to make points (two or more checkers) to block opponent
- When bearing off, remove checkers efficiently"""
